# Surfs_Up_Challenge

## Overview

 For this challenge I further analyze weather data for Hawaii to determine if a Surf shop and ice cream business is sustainable all year round. Our first analysis only accounted for the last 12 months, however we will be incorportating more than 10 years of weather data, in order to provide a more accurate analysis.

The minimum temperature in June is 64 and in December 56
The standard deviation for June is 3.3 and in December 3.7
The count for June is 1700 compared to 1517 in December

## Summary


We can conclude that December has a wider range of temperatures compared to June. Half of the days in December have temperatures 71 or below and a minimum temperature of 56.InJune, half of the days have temperatures of 75 or lower and minimum temperature of 64. These results show how generally the summer months are warmer than the winter months. Though, the average temperature only varies by less than 4 degrees. In order to gather more information on weather data for the months of December and June, we should incorporate other measurements, such as precipitation.
